# Automation-Developer-Professional-Training

## Overview
Welcome to my repository for documenting all the exercises and projects from the **UiPath Automation Developer Professional Training**. This repository is organized to reflect the learning path provided by UiPath Academy, covering all three levels: **Explorer**, **Associate**, and **Professional**.

Each folder contains detailed exercises and projects from the respective modules, along with explanations and source files (.xaml) for automations built during the training. My goal is to track my progress and share insights gained from each module.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main sections, following the UiPath Academyâ€™s learning plan:
- **[Automation Explorer](./Explorer_Level/Module_1_Intro_RPA/)**
- **[Automation Developer Associate](./Explorer_Level/Module_2_Basic_Automation/)**
- **[Automation Developer Professional](./Explorer_Level/Module_3_Data_Manipulation_UI_Automation/)**

### Automation Explorer
This section covers the foundational concepts of RPA and simple automation scenarios. It includes introductory projects on UiPath Studio, basic data manipulation, and UI automation.

- **[Module 1: Introduction to RPA](./Explorer_Level/Module_1_Intro_RPA/)**
- **[Module 2: Basic Automation Concepts](./Explorer_Level/Module_2_Basic_Automation/)**
- **[Module 3: Basic Data Manipulation and UI Automation](./Explorer_Level/Module_3_Data_Manipulation_UI_Automation/)**

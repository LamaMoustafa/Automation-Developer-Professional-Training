# Use-case/ problem statement

Further develop the automation process built in the previous lesson. The task is to iterate through the documents extracted from the .zip file and extend the functionality to sort not only the contracts but also the invoices into their respective folders. Broken down in steps, you should:
- Extract the contents of the .zip file.
- Rename the contract and invoice files by incorporating the corresponding folder (company) names.
- Save the renamed contract files in separate folders based on the company names.
- Create a specified folder for invoices.
- Rename all invoice files by appending the original invoice name with the respective company name (e.g., Invoice 001 01092022 Megatronic Incorporated.pdf).
- Move the renamed invoice files to the Invoices folder.
- Generate a Processed folder and transfer the original .zip file into it once all operations are complete.
